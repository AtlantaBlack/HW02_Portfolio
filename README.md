# BCS HW 02 - Professional Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio is an important thing for any web developer to have. A well-designed and functional (not to mention accessible) website is a great way to showcase their skills and projects, no matter if the audience is potential clients or simply the world at large.

As a brand new web developer, I have recently learnt about Flexbox and media queries. In my portfolio I have applied it to sections and elements throughout the page so that an aesthetically-pleasing and user-friendly layout can be produced. There were many challenges, most of them having to do with figuring out how flex actually worked. In the end I feel as though I have gained a great deal of new knowledge about CSS, Flexbox, and media queries, and how to use them, at least for now, semi-confidently.
